**[Benday.Presentation.Controls](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Benday.Presentation.Controls/)** is a collection of reusable controls for displaying and editing data in an model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) application that uses MAUI .NET. These controls use the MVVM utilities in Benday.Presentation. 

More documentation coming soon but here's a list of controls:

* TextboxField
* ListboxField
* ComboboxField
* LabelField

The **Benday.ControlsAndViewModelSample** project in this repository is a simple sample application that uses the features of the Benday.Presentation and Benday.Presentation.Controls packages. The goal of this sample application is to move as much logic as possible out of the XAML files and into ViewModels and then to rely almost exclusively on data binding and command binding.
